# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an AI-powered Decision Support System (DSS) for train management that automates manual scheduling processes currently performed by train traffic controllers. The system integrates multiple data sources and uses machine learning algorithms to optimize train operations, handle crossing priorities, and provide intelligent scheduling recommendations while maintaining safety and efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a train traffic controller, I want an AI-powered system to automatically generate optimal train schedules, so that I can reduce manual scheduling work while improving efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives train requests THEN the AI SHALL generate optimal schedules considering all constraints and priorities
2. WHEN conflicts arise in scheduling THEN the system SHALL automatically resolve them using ML algorithms and priority rules
3. WHEN schedule changes are needed THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate and optimize the entire network schedule
4. IF manual override is required THEN the system SHALL allow controllers to modify AI recommendations while maintaining safety constraints

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a railway operations manager, I want to monitor real-time train positions and movements, so that I can ensure safe and efficient operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a train moves along the track THEN the system SHALL update its real-time position every 30 seconds
2. WHEN two trains approach each other THEN the system SHALL alert operators if safety distances are compromised
3. WHEN a train deviates from its scheduled route THEN the system SHALL generate an immediate alert
4. IF communication with a train is lost THEN the system SHALL flag the train as "communication lost" and alert dispatchers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a maintenance supervisor, I want to access track infrastructure data, so that I can plan maintenance activities and ensure track safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing infrastructure data THEN the system SHALL display track segments, signals, switches, and stations
2. WHEN maintenance is scheduled THEN the system SHALL mark affected track sections as unavailable
3. WHEN track conditions change THEN the system SHALL update infrastructure status and notify relevant personnel
4. IF critical infrastructure fails THEN the system SHALL immediately restrict train access to affected areas

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a train operator, I want to receive weather-related alerts and recommendations, so that I can adjust operations for safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN severe weather conditions are detected THEN the system SHALL issue speed restrictions for affected routes
2. WHEN weather impacts visibility THEN the system SHALL recommend enhanced safety protocols
3. WHEN weather data is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically assess impact on current operations
4. IF extreme weather threatens safety THEN the system SHALL recommend service suspension for affected routes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a safety officer, I want the system to enforce operational rules and constraints, so that all train movements comply with safety regulations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a train movement is planned THEN the system SHALL validate it against all operational rules
2. WHEN operational constraints are violated THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and alert operators
3. WHEN new safety rules are implemented THEN the system SHALL update constraint validation accordingly
4. IF emergency situations arise THEN the system SHALL override normal constraints while maintaining safety protocols

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a train traffic controller, I want the system to automatically handle train priorities at crossings and junctions, so that high-priority trains are given precedence while maintaining overall network efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trains approach a crossing simultaneously THEN the system SHALL automatically determine priority based on predefined rules and train classifications
2. WHEN priority conflicts occur THEN the AI SHALL resolve them considering passenger vs freight, express vs local, and schedule criticality
3. WHEN priority decisions are made THEN the system SHALL automatically adjust signals and notify affected trains
4. IF emergency or high-priority trains require passage THEN the system SHALL override normal priority rules and clear the path immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage data integration from multiple sources, so that the AI system has accurate and up-to-date information for decision making.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external data sources provide updates THEN the system SHALL integrate the data within 5 minutes and retrain relevant ML models
2. WHEN data conflicts occur between sources THEN the system SHALL use AI to resolve inconsistencies and flag critical conflicts for review
3. WHEN data sources become unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached data and adjust AI confidence levels accordingly
4. IF data integrity issues are detected THEN the system SHALL quarantine suspect data and automatically adjust ML model inputs

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a railway operations manager, I want the AI system to learn from historical data and continuously improve scheduling decisions, so that operations become more efficient over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN it SHALL continuously collect performance data and learn from scheduling outcomes
2. WHEN patterns are identified THEN the ML models SHALL automatically update to improve future scheduling decisions
3. WHEN new operational scenarios occur THEN the system SHALL adapt its decision-making algorithms accordingly
4. IF system performance degrades THEN the AI SHALL automatically retrain models using recent data and alert administrators
